You can begin making queries in our hosted GraphQL [playground](https://ourZORA.github.io/indexer-playground/) on both `Ethereum Mainnet` and `Rinkeby`.

## Ethereum Data

The ZORA Indexer stores the raw data for `Transactions` and `Event Logs` that it finds "interesting", namely transactions that interact
with the ZORA Protocol or that result in a transfer of an ERC-721 NFT.

### Transaciton

```graphql
{
  Transaction {
  # Fields
  blockHash
  blockNumber
  blockTimestamp
  failureReason
  from
  gas
  gasPrice
  hash
  input
  network
  nonce
  status
  to
  transactionIndex
  value

  # Relationships
  eventLogs
  <event table name>Events # i.e. auctionApprovalUpdatedEvents)
  mediaMints # see MediaMint table for context
  }
}
```

### Event Log

```graphql
{
  EventLog {
  # Fields
  address
  blockHash
  blockNumber
  blockTimestamp
  data
  id # format: <transactionHash>-<logIndex> i.e. 0xbd7c2c6e978cc78e826ddc9404c769b6151cf762ac43e78bafade98b7d3dd5e1-24
  logIndex
  topics
  transactionHash

  # Relationships
  <event table name>Event # i.e. auctionApprovalUpdatedEvent
  mediaMints # see MediaMint table for context
  transaction
  }
}
```

## Aggregated Tables

The Indexer keeps track of aggregated tables that represent the most up to date state of an object. At
any block number, the aggregate view will mirror the view of the object on the blockchain. `Token`, `Media`, and
`Auction` are the three aggregate tables.

### Token

Non ZORA ERC-721 NFTs

```graphql
{
  Token {
  # Fields
  address # contract address
  id # format: <address>-<tokenId> i.e. 0x7C2668BD0D3c050703CEcC956C11Bd520c26f7d4-241
  metadataId # this is a uuid to make the metadata relationship possible
  mintTransferEventId # same format as EventLog id, to make mintTransferEvent relationship possible
  minter # same as mintTransferEvent.to
  name
  owner
  supportsMetadata
  symbol
  tokenId
  tokenURI

  # Relationships
  auctions # all Auctions for this token
  <event table name>Event # i.e. auctionApprovalUpdatedEvent
  media # ZORA Media info (only available for ZORA NFTs)
  metadata # metadata json blob, if exists
  mintTransferEvent # TokenTransferEvent where .from is the 0x00... address
  tokenContract # TokenContract has information like name and symbol
  transferEvents # all TokenTransferEvents
  }
}
```

### Media

ZORA NFTs - view [Media.sol](https://github.com/ourZORA/core/blob/master/contracts/Media.sol) for context

```graphql
{
  Media {
    # Fields
    address # always the same contract address, makes many relationships possible
    contentHash
    contentURI
    creator
    creatorBidShare
    metadataHash
    metadataURI
    mintTransferEventId
    owner
    ownerBidShare
    prevOwner
    prevOwnerBidShare
    tokenId

    # Relationships
    askEvents # array of MarketAskEvents
    asks # array of MarketAsks
    auctions # array of Auctions for this token
    bidEvents # array of MarketBidEvents
    bids # array of MarketBids
    metadata # metadata json blob
    token # Token
    tokenMetadataURIUpdatedEvents # array of MediaTokenMetadataURIUpdatedEvents
    tokenURIUpdatedEvents # array of MediaTokenURIUpdatedEvents
    transferEvents # array of TokenTransferEvents
  }
}
```

### Auction

ZORA Auction House - view [AuctionHouse.sol](https://github.com/ourZORA/auction-house/blob/main/contracts/AuctionHouse.sol) contract for more context

```graphql
// many Auction fields and relationships can be null depending on the state of the auction
{
  Auction {
  # Fields
  amountTokenOwnerReceived
  approved
  auctionCurrency
  auctionId
  curator
  curatorFee
  curatorFeePercentage
  duration # always current with AuctionDurationExtended events
  expiresAt - firstBidTime + current duration
  firstBidTime
  lastBidAmount
  lastBidder
  reservePrice
  tokenContract
  tokenId
  tokenOwner
  winner

  # Relationships
  approvalEvents # array of AuctionApprovalEvents
  bidEvents # array of AuctionBidEvents
  canceledEvent # single AuctionCanceledEvent
  createdEvent # single AuctionCreatedEvent
  durationExtendedEvents # array of AuctionDurationExtendedEvents
  endedEvent # single AuctionEndedEvent
  media # single Media object if the token is a ZORA NFT
  reservePriceUpdatedEvents # array of AuctionReservePriceUpdatedEvents
  token # single Token object
  }
}
```

## Event Tables

Protocol event tables are generally named by the following format:

`<contract name><exact name for the event>Event.`

- ZORA's Auction House events have the prefix `Auction`
- ZORA Media and Market events have prefixes `Media` and `Market`
- Generic ERC-721 events have the prefix `Token`.

The field names should match the specific contract
event field names (exception: a struct in an event will be flattened into all the struct field names), plus there are several
other useful fields that all `Event` tables share.

```graphql
# ZORA AuctionHouse AuctionBid event - see contract for more context

{
  AuctionBidEvent {
  # common Event fields
  address # contract that emitted event
  blockNumber
  blockTimestamp
  eventLogId
  id # same format as EventLog, so same as eventLogId
  logIndex
  transactionHash

  # event-specific fields
  auctionId
  extended
  firstBid
  sender
  tokenContract
  tokenId
  value

  # common Event relationships
  eventLog
  transaction
  media
  token

  # event-specific relationships
  auction # all Auction__ events have this
  }
}
```

## Other Tables

`TokenContract` is how the Indexer keeps track of the contracts it is monitoring.

```graphql
{
  TokenContract {
    # fields
    address
    deployedAtBlockNumber
    name
    supportsMetadata # supports ERC721Metadata standard
    symbol
  }
}
```

`TokenMetadata` stores a metadata JSON blob and information associating it with a specific token. There may be many `TokenMetadata`
entries with the same URI and thus the same metadata.

```graphql
{
  TokenMetadata {
    # fields
    address # Token address
    id # uuid, ignore
    json # data blob
    tokenId
    tokenURI

    # relationships
    token
  }
}
```
